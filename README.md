# Hypermedia project. Part 1
## Project analysis, Information architecture
I have designed my web résumé to present information in a clear and visually appealing way. At the top of the page, there is a picture of me accompanied by essential personal details such as my full name, email address, and phone number, along with direct links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. Below this section, there is a short description about me, where I introduce myself. To the right of my profile, there is a dynamic slider that showcases the most important projects I have worked on. Each slide includes a brief explanation of the project and a link that redirects visitors to explore it in detail. When scrolling down, users can access an accordion section that reveals my academic background and work experience, displayed chronologically from the beginning to the most recent update. This is followed by a section showing the languages I speak, along with their fluency levels. Further down, there are two columns: the left one presents my key technical skills represented by progress bars, while the right column includes a radar chart illustrating my soft skills, rated from 0 to 100. Finally, the portfolio section displays all my projects, each linked to its GitHub repository through a clickable image.
