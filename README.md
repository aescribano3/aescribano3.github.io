# Hypermedia project. Part 1
## Project analysis, Information architecture
I have designed my web cv to present information in a clear and visually appealing way. At the top of the page, there is a picture of me accompanied by essential personal details such as my full name, email address, and phone number, along with direct links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. Below this section, there is a short description about me, where I introduce myself.

To the right of my profile, there is a dynamic slider that showcases the most important projects I have worked on. Each slide includes a brief explanation of the project and a link that redirects visitors to explore it in detail. When scrolling down, users can access an accordion section that reveals my academic background and work experience, displayed chronologically from the beginning to the most recent update.

This is followed by a section showing the languages I speak, along with their fluency levels. Further down, there are two columns: the left one presents my key technical skills represented by progress bars, while the right column includes a radar chart illustrating my soft skills, rated from 0 to 100.

Finally, the portfolio section displays all my projects, each linked to its GitHub repository through a clickable image.
## Project analysis, Visual design
The design of my web cv follows a modern, minimalist, and futuristic aesthetic focused on clarity and user experience. The layout uses a dark background combined with vibrant cyan and purple accents to create a high-contrast and professional appearance. Typography is clean and readable, with different font weights to distinguish between headings, body text, and highlighted information.

At the top, the interface is divided into two main sections. On the left side, my profile photo appears inside a subtle rounded frame, followed by my name in a glowing turquoise tone, contact details, and social media buttons with smooth hover effects. Both the buttons and the email address emit a soft glow when hovered over, adding an interactive and dynamic feel to the design. On the right side, a horizontal slider displays my featured projects with short descriptions and navigation arrows that allow users to explore each one interactively.

As the user scrolls down, the transitions are smooth and consistent. The accordion for education and experience features soft shadows and rounded corners, keeping the design cohesive. The languages section uses flag icons and progress bars that match the overall color palette.
The lower part of the site is organized into two columns, showing technical and soft skills with animated bars and a responsive radar chart. Finally, the portfolio section presents project thumbnails inside minimalist cards that slightly enlarge on hover.

The website is mainly built using Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript, and to make it more personalized, I created several custom CSS classes that enhance the overall visual style and interactivity.
